Bar Chart: You can create a bar chart to compare the average idle time across different stations. Each bar represents a station, and the height of the bar represents the average idle time. This can help identify stations with higher or lower idle times.

Line Plot: A line plot can be used to visualize the variation in the average idle time throughout the day. The x-axis represents the different time periods (morning, late morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night), and the y-axis represents the average idle time. This visualization can reveal any patterns or trends in the idle time throughout the day.

Heatmap: A heatmap can show the relationship between the station's latitude and longitude and the average idle time. The x-axis represents longitude, the y-axis represents latitude, and the color intensity represents the average idle time. This visualization can provide insights into geographical patterns and identify areas with higher or lower idle times.

Scatter Plot: You can create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the average idle time and the counts for each time period (morning, late morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night). Each point represents a station, and the x-axis represents the count for a specific time period, while the y-axis represents the average idle time. This visualization can help identify any correlation between the count and idle time.

Geographic Map: You can plot the stations on a geographic map using latitude and longitude coordinates. You can use different marker sizes or colors to represent the average idle time at each station. This visualization can provide a spatial perspective of the average idle time across different stations.

Remember, the choice of visualization depends on the specific insights you want to gain from your data. You can use these suggestions as a starting point and tailor them to your specific needs.
